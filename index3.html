  <pre id="biblestudy-md"># **Welcome to Men’s Bible Study**

This is a study on **The Spirit of Prophecy** — how God speaks through His people for the strengthening of the Church.

---

## **Tonight’s Focus**

We’re exploring what it means that *“the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.”*  
How prophecy operates through weakness, faith, and obedience — not ego.

---

# **The Foundation: Power in Weakness**

[Bible: 1 Corinthians 2:1–5, 10–13 (NASB)]

> “I was with you in weakness and fear and in much trembling,  
> and my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom,  
> but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.”  

## **Key Questions**

- Why does Paul link weakness with the power of the Spirit?  
- How does being “one spirit with the Lord” (1 Cor 6:17) prepare us to hear God?  
- How do humility and dependence sharpen prophetic sensitivity?

---

# **Prophecy in the Early Church**

We look at how ordinary believers in *Acts* heard and responded to the Spirit.

[Bible: Acts 8:26–29; Acts 9:10–17; Acts 10:19–20; Acts 11:27–30; Acts 13:1–3; Acts 16:6–10 (NASB)]

## **Key Observations**

- The Spirit often spoke through **simple obedience**, not spectacle.  
- Prophecy guided mission, comforted the Church, and warned of trials.  
- The same Spirit who gave visions also whispered “Go join that chariot.”

## **Discussion Points**

1. What do these examples teach about daily listening to the Spirit?  
2. How does obedience to small promptings build faith for greater assignments?  
3. How can we cultivate an Acts-like attentiveness today?

---

# **Desiring the Gift**

[Bible: 1 Corinthians 14:1–5; 1 Thessalonians 5:19–21 (NASB)]

> “Pursue love, yet desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.”

## **Reflection Questions**

- Why does Scripture tell us to *desire* this gift?  
- What does it mean to “test everything” without despising prophecy?  
- How can we practice discernment together in community?

---

# **Guardrails for False Prophets**

[Bible: Deuteronomy 18:20–22 (NASB)]

> “When the prophet speaks in the name of the Lord, and the thing does not happen or come true,  
> that is the thing which the Lord has not spoken.”

## **Key Discussion Points**

- God’s standard for truth keeps His people safe.  
- The measure is not emotion, but **faithful fulfillment**.  
- False prophecy is often born from presumption, not revelation.

---

# **Jeremiah’s Calling and Training**

[Bible: Jeremiah 1:4–12 (NASB)]

> “The word of the Lord came to me, saying, ‘What do you see, Jeremiah?’  
> And I said, ‘I see a branch of an almond tree.’  
> Then the Lord said to me, ‘You have seen well, for I am watching over My word to perform it.’”

## **Discussion Points**

1. God begins with a question — *What do you see?*  
2. Prophetic training starts with learning to see and say only what God shows.  
3. Revelation often carries meaning through imagery and wordplay (the almond tree / “watching”).

# **The False Prophet and the Broken Yoke**

[Bible: Jeremiah 28:10–17 (NASB)]

> “Listen now, Hananiah, the Lord has not sent you, and you have made this people trust in a lie.”

## **Key Lessons**

- Hananiah *chose* his own message — Jeremiah *carried* God’s message.  
- Breaking the wooden yoke led to an iron one — false comfort leads to bondage.  
- True prophecy aligns with God’s Word even when it’s unpopular.

---

# **Amos: Called from the Field**

[Bible: Amos 7:14–15 (NASB)]

> “I am not a prophet, nor am I the son of a prophet; for I am a herdsman…  
> But the Lord took me from following the flock, and said, ‘Go, prophesy to My people Israel.’”

## **Reflection**

- God uses ordinary men to speak extraordinary truth.  
- Prophetic calling begins in obedience, not credentials.  
- The Spirit of prophecy still calls men from their work to speak His Word.

---

# **Prayer: That We Might Believe**

[Bible: Mark 9:23–24 (NASB)]

> “‘If You can?’ All things are possible for the one who believes.”  
> Immediately the boy’s father cried out and said, “I do believe; help my unbelief!”

## **Prayer Points**

- Lord, make us sensitive to Your Spirit.  
- Teach us to hear and obey without pride.  
- Let prophecy in our lives glorify Jesus and strengthen His Church.  
- Help our unbelief, and make faith our response to Your Word.

# **Next Week**

We’ll continue with **Discerning Modern Prophecy** — testing the word, not despising it.  
Bring examples, questions, and testimonies from your own walk.

[Bible: Revelation 19:10; 1 John 4:1–3]
