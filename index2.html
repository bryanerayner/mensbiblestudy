# Welcome to Men's Bible Study

This is an example study on **Faith and Action**. Use this as a template for your own studies.

## Tonight's Focus

We'll be exploring how faith without works is dead, and what it means to live out our faith authentically.

# The Foundation: James 2:14–26

[Bible: James 2:14–26]

## Key Questions

- What does James mean by "faith without works is dead"?
- How do we balance grace through faith with the call to action?
- What are practical ways we can demonstrate our faith this week?

# Abraham's Example

Abraham is called the "father of faith" — but what made his faith so remarkable?

[Bible: Genesis 22:1–18]

## Discussion Points

1. **Obedience** — Abraham didn't hesitate when God called
2. **Trust** — He believed God would provide
3. **Action** — His faith led to concrete steps

> "Faith is taking the first step even when you don't see the whole staircase." — Martin Luther King Jr.

# Modern Application

How do we apply this ancient wisdom to our lives today?

## Practical Steps

- **This Week**: Identify one area where you need to act on your faith
- **Daily**: Spend 10 minutes in prayer asking God for courage
- **Community**: Share your commitment with the group for accountability

# Closing Thoughts

Remember: Faith is not passive. It's an active, living relationship with God that transforms how we live.

## Prayer Points

- Courage to act on our convictions
- Wisdom to know when to speak and when to listen
- Strength to support each other in our faith journeys

# Next Week

We'll be studying **The Power of Prayer** — come prepared with your questions and experiences!

[Bible: Matthew 6:5–15]
