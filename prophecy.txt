 - We are encouraged to prophesy _to evangelize_.

# How can we?
 - The mind of Christ
 - We are one spirit with the Lord.

# Testing the prophets
 - Deut 13. If they lead you to another God, they are false.
 - Unfilfilled blessings or curses could just be you making God change his decision.
 - The thing to fear is the prophet

   - "There is healing in these hands"

 - Prophecy started the gift of healing.
